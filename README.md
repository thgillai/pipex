# pipex
This project is the discovery in detail and by programming of a UNIX
mechanism, the pipe.

My objective is to code the Pipex program.

The execution of the pipex program do the same as the next shell command: $> < file1 cmd1 | cmd2 > file2

My program work like that: $> ./pipex infile "cmd1" "cmd2" outfile
